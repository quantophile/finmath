    "**Exercise 1.6** (Hedging a long position-one period). Consider a bank that has a long position in the European call written on the stock price in figure 1.1.2. The call expires at time one and has strike price $K=5$. In section 1.1, we determined the time-zero price of this call to be $V_0 = 1.20$. At time zero, the bank owns this option, which ties up capital $V_0 = 1.20$. The bank wants to earn the interest rate $25$\\% on this capital until time one i.e. without investing any more money, regardless of how the coin tossing turns out, the bank wants to have\n",
